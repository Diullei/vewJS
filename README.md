Video Element Watcher - A script to watch &lt;video> element

Still testing. To do it, you have to:

* Add a class named `vew` to the `<video>` element
* Add the content of this bookmarklet to your modern browser: [vewJS](https://raw.github.com/danielfilho/vewJS/dev/vewjs.bookmarklet.js)
* Click it when your page is loaded
* Play the video and watch it :)
